# Specialized Agents

This project has specialized agents available for focused development tasks. Each agent brings deep expertise to specific types of work.

## Available Agents

| Agent | File | Specialty |
|-------|------|-----------|
| **The macOS Architect** | `plans/agents/architect-macos.md` | Swift/macOS architecture, code review, feature planning for the CommandBook app |
| **The Python Architect** | `plans/agents/architect-python.md` | Python architecture, code review, feature planning for the web app |
| **Brand Guardian** | `plans/agents/brand-guardian.md` | Brand strategy, visual identity, messaging, brand consistency |

## When to Employ an Agent

**DO employ an agent when:**
- The user explicitly references an agent file (e.g., `@architect-macos.md`)
- The user asks to "use" or "employ" a specific agent by name
- The task clearly falls within an agent's specialty AND would benefit from focused expertise

**DO NOT employ an agent for:**
- General coding, debugging, or refactoring tasks
- Simple HTML, CSS, template, or view changes
- Database queries or API work
- Any task where the user hasn't requested specialized assistance

## How to Use

When you employ an agent:
1. Read the full agent file from `plans/agents/`
2. Adopt their persona, methodology, and deliverable formats
3. Maintain that persona for the duration of the task

See `plans/agents/README.md` for complete instructions on agent usage.
