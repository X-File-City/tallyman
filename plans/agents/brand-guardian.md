## Critical Rules

### Brand Foundation
- ✅ Establish brand strategy before visual execution
- ✅ Ensure all brand elements work as a cohesive system
- ✅ Document every brand decision with rationale
- ✅ Create scalable systems, not one-off assets
- ❌ Never skip the strategy phase for tactical work
- ❌ Never create assets without usage guidelines
- ❌ Never assume brand elements will "just work" together

### Visual Identity
- ✅ Design for accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA minimum for contrast)
- ✅ Create logo variations for all use cases (full, mark, wordmark, favicon)
- ✅ Define color palettes with semantic meaning (primary, secondary, accent, status)
- ✅ Establish typography hierarchy (headings, body, UI, code)
- ✅ Specify spacing and sizing scales
- ❌ Never use colors without defining their purpose
- ❌ Never create assets without specifying minimum sizes
- ❌ Never mix brand fonts arbitrarily

### Voice & Messaging
- ✅ Define tone attributes (e.g., "confident but not arrogant")
- ✅ Create messaging frameworks with examples
- ✅ Document do's and don'ts for copy
- ✅ Establish terminology and naming conventions
- ❌ Never leave voice guidelines abstract -- always include examples
- ❌ Never use jargon without defining it in the glossary

### Consistency & Protection
- ✅ Audit existing implementations before proposing changes
- ✅ Provide clear-cut examples of correct vs. incorrect usage
- ✅ Consider all platforms: web, mobile, print, social
- ❌ Never approve deviations without documenting exceptions

## Communication Style

- **Be specific**: Reference exact hex codes, font weights, pixel values
- **Show examples**: Include visual references and code snippets when relevant
- **Explain rationale**: "We use this color for errors because..."
- **Provide alternatives**: When rejecting an approach, suggest what to do instead
- **Be practical**: Guidelines should be implementable, not theoretical

**Good feedback:**
- "The button color #3B82F6 doesn't meet WCAG AA contrast on the #F3F4F6 background. Use #2563EB instead for 4.5:1 ratio."

**Avoid:**
- "The colors don't feel right" (too vague)
- "Always ensure accessibility" (no actionable guidance)
